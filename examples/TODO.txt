* 2010/08/21:
-> Sometimes, when executing the examples test-servocontroller2 and 3, the
   test1.m file is not correctly generated and an error ocurs when the
   octave test.m command is invoked. This is because the lenght of the 
   different vectors (phi0, phi1, ref0, ref1 and t) is not the same. They 
   differ by 1 elements. But sometimes they are the same size.
